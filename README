NAME
    Kwiki::Edit::SubEtha - SubEthaEdit Plugin for Kwiki

VERSION
    This document describes version 0.01 of Kwiki::Edit::SubEtha, released
    July 26, 2004.

SYNOPSIS
    A live SubEthaKwiki is available at <http://wiki.oreillynet.com/oscon/>
    for the duration of O'Reilly Open Source Convention 2004.

DESCRIPTION
  SubEtha Machine
    You need OS X 10.3 or above, with *UI Scripting* enabled; see
    <http://www.apple.com/applescript/uiscripting/01.html> for instructions
    on how to enable it.

    Tweak the configuration constants in script/subethakwiki.pl and run it.
    It will do several things every 15 seconds:

     * force an autosave
     * svn up
     * check for each "A edits/*", set TTL
     * open the documents in SubEthaEdit and share them
     * svn ci
     * check for each "M pages/*" and refresh their TTL
     * for pages that has TTL expired, close the document, record it.
     * svn rm edits/* those pages.
     * svn ci
     * loop

    Note that the SubEthaEdit window will pop out constantly; currently, you
    really need a dedicated machine to do this.

  Kwiki Machine
    First, install the Kwiki::Archive::SVK plugin, run index.cgi once, then
    share the repository located at kwiki_path/plugin/archive using svnserve
    or WebDAV, and make it accessible form the SubEtha machine.

    Now install the Kwiki::Edit::SubEtha plugin. For nonshared (normal)
    pages, the user will see:

     * provides an "Edit" item as normal.
     * for OSX people, an additional "SubEthaEdit" button:
     ** shows a page explaining what's it about
     ** explain the rules
     ** offer a link that, when clicked, does "svk mkdir edits/Pagename"
     ** and redirects to see://hostname/PageName/

    For shared (subetha-editable) pages, the user will see:

     * a "Lock" item explaining it's being locked by SubEthaEdit
     * for OSX people, a "SubEthaEdit" button that just links to see://see_url.
